        <p>Some of the responsibilities that I was required to engage in were teaching students who varied from different grade levels (Elementary-Middle School Students) different forms and styles of art. Additionally, on days where I did not teach art, I instead graded tests, quizes and worksheets that the students had completed over the course of the week. On some occassions, I would enter in student's weekly report that the parents would get to view in order to determine the progress made by the student. Finally, I also created worksheets and notes pages for students to use in the future.</p>

          <li>Drawing/Painting/Art - I have been attending an art class since I was in Kindergraden, and I absoultely love it!

          <br>
          <li>Baking - Baking is another stress reliever for me, it helps me create and combine. I feel like baking expresses the slightly adventurous and outgoing part of me since I always like to try new recipes and think of ways that can make an existing recipe taste better.</li>
          <br>
          <li>Photography - I enjoy photgraphy since it allows for me to experience the world in a different perspective. I usually like to photograph nature, more than people which helps me enjoy my surroundings.</li>
          <br>
          <li>Basketball - Basketball has been a sport that has always helped me relax. I have been playing the game since 4th grade and it has always made me feel less stressed about my schoolwork.
