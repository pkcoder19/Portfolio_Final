    <h4>Field Trip Experiences</h5>
    <h5>Stryker Lab</h6>
    <h6>G.E.T. S.E.T Club</h6>
    <p>The Field Trip to Stryker was a great way for me to learn and understand about the different types of jobs and roles that scientists played in a single company. During the Field Trip I learned about how scientists from numerous different majors such as Biology, Chemistry, and more used their knowledge and applied it improving medical equipment that helped doctors operate better. This showed me that I could use my passion of science and apply what I had learned about Computer Science to any field that I wanted to go into to gain more opportunities. This trip also showed me that there were so many different options and different career types that I could go into, and that I wasn't limited to a select few.</p>

      <h4>Guest Speaker Experiences</h4>
      <h5>Alan Borecky</h5>
      <h6>Computer Science Principles</h6>
      <p>Mr. Borecky's talk was a great experience since it opened my eyes up to the various different technqiues that could be used to write code. Specifically what fascinated me about this talk was when we learned about how code could be wirtten and fromatted in a manner which would make it easier for the computer to understand, and thus make the overall process much cleaner and help the computer to execute the code much more efficently.

      <h5>Devon Martin</h5>
      <h6>Computer Science Principles</h6>
      <p>Mr. Martin's talk helped me realize that more than actually understanding the syntax and a specific coding language it is important to understand and be able to write accurate logic. This helped me understand that the porficiency of a computer language shouldn't stop your motivation to create a new program, or try something new in terms of programming porjects.

      <h5>Cesar Nicola</h5>
      <h6>Computer Science Principles</h6>
      <p>Mr. Nicola's talk focused on the organization and planning of large projects such as projects in a company. He mostly focused on Agile and the SCRUM process. I learned that there are multiple different types of ways that companies can outline their developmental porcess such as Agile and Waterfall, and that both methods had different strengths which are consequently used for different types of projects. I also learned that Agile consisted of sprints which were work periods that were used to focus on one portion of the product. This adds to the whole point of Agile since it focuses on quickly creating a product based on user and client feedback in order to create a product that fits the vision of the client.
