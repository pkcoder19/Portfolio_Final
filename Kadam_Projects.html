      <em><p>September 23 2019 - October 8 2019</p></em>
       <p>Using the software M.I.T App Inventor, my partner and I added features to the existing game Mini Golf to ideally improve and potentially debug the application. We incorporated certain challenges such as the amount of strokes a player got to use per hole. Furthermore, certain incentives such as a winning score was added to further add depth to the game</p>
