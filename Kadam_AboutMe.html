       <p>"If you do what you love, you will never work a day in your life" ~ Marc Anthony. Throughout school, the sciences have always fascinated me, so to continue with my passions in the future I would like to incorporate research sciences into my career. That being said, some of my other career goals include working on research that focuses on finding solutions to some of most the immediate and detrimental issues that present in the world. Most of these issues correspond with facets of the medical and pharmaceutical field, so I am leaning towards establishing a research career in one of the branches of these fields. To achieve my goal, I will be required to attend a four-year university as well as complete a master's program. Additionally, my field and career type will most likely require me to gain a type of higher degree such as a Ph.D. or other certifications based on the area I decide to specialize in. Choosing a career that incorporates research science is important to me since problem-solving and developing new explanations and ideas allows me to channel my inner creativity to ideally solve problems with out of the box solutions. As for my choice in the medical field, I enjoy seeing the results of my actions first hand, and I realize that working in the medical field will allow me to see how my work is impacting thousands and maybe even millions of individuals all around the world. That is truly empowering.</p>

       <p>An experience that relates to my future career is the Dublin High and Golden Gate Science Fairs. I believe that the project idea that I came up with expressed my creativity since the project consisted of creating a design for an umbrella that prevented it for flipping inside-out, which is still an issue today. These fairs helped me develop skills such as being resourceful and a risk-taker. The project that my team and I did was to modernize an umbrella, we had to create multiple designs and each design possessed its own set of risks and drawbacks, however using the resources that I had I was able to make the design of the umbrella work. Additionally, I was very responsible and sincere about the work that I did since most of the umbrella prototype had to be stitched by hand, and I had to make sure that I finished the work before the deadline. As a sophmore, there is still a large portion of my high school career that I have yet to experience. However, with the time I have spent Dublin High I have still achieved a great deal including being the Team Captain and MVP of my basketball team as well as winning 4th place in the Golden Gate Science fair.</p>

       <p>High school and experiencing new and unqiue experience has truly helped my grow and learn about myself as a person. For one, High school has taught me about perseverance and hardwork. Before high school, I never realized how important both qualities are in order to be successful. Hardwork and perseverence contribute in ensuring that an individual works through hardships without giving up. Often times in high school classes that are advanced, honors and AP courses can be tough, but with my resilient qualities I make sure that I complete the work that I started. This has helped me value the worth of my success since I understand the true value of the work that I have completed. Additionally, I also learned that I am a quick learner, and that I am open to new experience since before joining the Computer Science Principles class I did not know much about computers or coding in general, but after I started the course I learned how to use different coding languages as well as logic to create programs. Furthermore, I am responsible and reliable since most of the work I do, whether it is at school or for my club, constantly requires me to coordinate and submit the work that I do with others. Responsibility plays a role here since it assures that I have all the work done before a deadline. Reliability is also key in this case since my classmates and correspondants have to coordinated and make sure that I do my work and am available to deliver the work. </p>
